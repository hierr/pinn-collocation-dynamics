# Experimental results

This document consolidates accepted comparisons and brief interpretation.
Detailed validation and tuning artifacts remain on their respective branches;
full frozen-setting evaluation campaigns will be retained on `main`.

## Generated Burgers reference validation

At viscosity `0.01/pi`, the generated N1024 solution was validated against the
original PACMANN reference over `[-1, 1] × [0, 0.99]`. Chebyshev barycentric
interpolation onto the original 256-point spatial grid and its 100 exact snapshot
times gave a reference disagreement of **0.000319% relative L2**.

Using the same final PACMANN models for seeds 2000–2002, replacing the original
reference with N1024 on that common grid changed the models' final relative L2
error scores by **less than 0.006% relative to the original scores**. This is a
change in measured model error, distinct from the reference-solution difference.
No retraining was needed. The check supports N1024 for this benchmark; it does
not certify absolute solver accuracy or other viscosities.

Evidence is retained on `dataset-validation`, commit `3a7b653`, in
`dataset_validation/` and `data/burgers_dataset/reference_comparison/`.
The latter includes the comparison READMEs, N512/N1024 solver comparisons,
three-model error table and figure, and unchanged source-model inputs.

## Evaluation status

No full frozen-setting ten-seed evaluation has been completed. Earlier
original-reference tuning runs and their comparison remain on
`hyperparameter-tuning`; they do not select settings for the new
per-viscosity generated-reference study. See the [study plan](research_context.md).
